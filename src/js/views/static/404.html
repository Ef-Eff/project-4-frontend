<h1>Goodbye WDI-25, I just have to say that I hate you all and always have hated you. The truth is that I have a special place in my heart for Ajay and all anyone does in this damn establishment is steal his attention away from me. I'm really shy, so approaching him is difficult for me, but assholes like Olivia and Sam are trying their hardest to keep him away from me. Jokes on them, I plan to steal Ajay for good with one simple trick. Its a secret though, can't be giving away my secrets now can I. There is so much text on the screen, nobody will notice I'm gay. Forreal tho, it has been absolutely great, thank you all for being amazing people (except Jake) and for making this experience more enjoyable than I could have imagined. This part probably wont get read so no worries, tbh I could write whatever I want. I already am anyway. Hmm. 'Bawler', 'LOLOLOLOL', seriously Mike? Thats like, so 2012 dude, like, seriously.
